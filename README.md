A program that simulates the Hot Potato game using a circular linked list. N players, numbered 1 to N, sit in a circle. The game starts at Player 1, and a "hot potato" is passed around. After M passes, the player holding the potato is eliminated. The circle closes ranks, and the next player continues with the potato. This process repeats until only one player remains, who is declared the winner. The program takes M and N as input, prints each eliminated player, and finally displays the winner. The circular linked list ensures efficient elimination and continuity of the game.
